# Andrew Olsen Portfolio

The purpose of this webpage is to showcase my work as I go through the coding bootcamp. 

I will continue to add my future projects to this portfolio as I go. 

I one day hope to be able to use this portfolio to help me get a job with an employer that values the work I have put in throughout this bootcamp.
